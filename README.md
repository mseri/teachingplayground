# Teaching Playground [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mseri/teachingplayground/main)

These are little experiments used during lectures or seminars, use at your own risk :)

The notebooks can be run remotely via binder or [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
In the first case it is enough to click on the binder badge above, in the second you can proceed as follows:

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Click on `GitHub` then paste `https://github.com/mseri/ProjectChaosTheory`
3. Click on `LogisticPopulation.ipynb` or any other `ipynb` file you want to work on.

Students of our university should be able to use `colab` using their students account, but I believe that `colab` is free to use for everybody for the moment.

You can also run all the notebooks locally with `jupyter`. In this case a recent version of `python`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` is required (see `requirements.txt` for a compatible set of dependencies).

## Examples of Chaotic Systems

- [Double Pendulum bot](https://twitter.com/pendulum_bot) and [J. Bertolotti animation](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doublependula.gif) -- [originally seen on twitter](https://twitter.com/j_bertolotti/status/1031466199866114049), of course, you can also [write your own simulation](https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/)
- [Triple Linkages](https://youtu.be/aVjj6VE-tNg)
- [Three body bot](https://twitter.com/ThreeBodyBot), but there are plenty of [interesting simulations around the web](https://twitter.com/simon_tardivel/status/1215728659010670594)
