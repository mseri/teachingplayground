# Playground

These are little experiments used during lectures or seminars, use at your own risk.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mseri/teachingplayground/main)

The notebooks can be run remotely via binder or [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), clocking on the badge above, or locally by using `jupyter`, a recent version of `python`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` is required (see `requirements.txt` for a compatible set of dependencies).
